## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed:

- [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
```

### Install dependencies

Run the following command to install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Running the API in Development Mode

To start the server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the server with [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/), which automatically restarts the server whenever file changes are detected.

### Running the API in Production Mode

To start the server in production mode:

```bash
npm start
```

The API will be running at:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

(You can change the port by modifying the environment variables.)

## API Endpoints

Here are some example routes for the API. Add your specific endpoints.

### User Routes

| Method | Endpoint         | Description         |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/users`     | Get all users       |
| POST   | `/api/users`     | Create a new user   |
| GET    | `/api/users/:id` | Get a user by ID    |
| PUT    | `/api/users/:id` | Update a user by ID |
| DELETE | `/api/users/:id` | Delete a user by ID |

### Authentication Routes

(You should list all your endpoints similarly.)

## Environment Variables

To configure environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

```plaintext
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values.

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
